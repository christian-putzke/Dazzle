# Dazzle and DazzleDS, SparkleShare host setup script

An easier and less error prone way to set up a SparkleShare host.

## DazzleDS Preperation

Before you can use DazzleDS with your Synology NAS you have to do some preperations within the DSM at first:

    # Create a DSM user called "storage"
    Control Panel -> User -> Create

    # Activate the user home service
    Control Panel -> User -> Advanded Tab -> Enable user home service
    
    # Install the Git Server Package from the DSM Package Center
    Package center -> Utilities -> Git Server -> install

    # Grant the DSM user "storage" the rights to use the git server
    Git Server -> Check "allow access" for the storage user
